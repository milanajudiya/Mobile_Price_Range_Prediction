<h2> :floppy_disk: Problem statement </h2>
In the competitive mobile phone market companies want to understand sales data of mobile phones and factors which drive the prices.The objective is to find out some relation between features of a mobile phone(eg:- RAM,Internal Memory, etc) and its selling price. In this problem, we do not have to predict the actual price but a price range indicating how high the price.

<h2> :book: Support Vector Machine Classifier </h2>
Support vector machine is supervised learning algorithm uses for both regression and classification. It is basically represent different classes in hyperplane. SVM divide the dataset into classes to find maximum marginal hyperplane. Support vectore machine classifier gives the best result for this dataset.

<h2> :clipboard: Execution Instruction</h2>
Mobile Price Range Prediction.ipynb file is Google colab file that can be run directly on google colab and this file can also be download and run on localy using VS code or Jupyter notebook.

<h2> :book: Steps Performed and Conclusion </h2>

As first step performed data wrangling, data preprocessing, and check for the missing value in dataset.

Performed EDA to observe trend and relation between features.

Trained the training data on different algorithm as random forest classifier, xg-boost, gradient boosting, logistic regression and Support vector machine classifier.

For model prediction splits the data into training and test data.

Support vector machine Classifier gives the Accuracy of 97% on test data.
